  - name: bash directory 
    run: pwd
    shell: bash  # windows does not have bash shell  but it will start vm for you

/* ---------------------------------- need ---------------------------------- */
by default  jobs run in parallel if job depends on anther use 
need: [ job name ]

ex:

# name : ahmed  comands

# on : [push]
# jobs :
#   run-dbah-commands:
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#     steps:
#       - name : echo a

    needs: [ sh-command]  # job  windows-command will runs after sh-command
      - name: runs command
