ex :
name : shell comands  #  user difine 

on : [push]
jobs :

- stata  Workflow Name:

name: shell commands: Specifies the name of the workflow.
Event Trigger:

on: [push]: Indicates that the workflow should be triggered on a push event.
Job:

jobs:: Begins the definition of jobs for the workflow.
run-shell-commands:: The job is named "run-shell-commands."
Operating System:

runs-on: ubuntu-latest: Specifies that the job runs on an Ubuntu environment.
Steps:

steps:: Begins the definition of steps for the job.
Step 1: Echo a String:

- name: echo a: The first step is named "echo a."
run: echo "hello world": Executes the echo command to print "hello world."
Step 2: Multiline Script:

- name: multiline script: The second step is named "multiline script."
run: |: Begins a multiline script block.
Copy code
node -v
npm -v

/* ---------------------- to enable more debug message ---------------------- */
go to settings  -> Secrets and variables  and add ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG  : true  , ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG:true 


/* ---------------------------- The run: | syntax --------------------------- */
is used to indicate the start of a multiline script block.
Here's an example of how you might use the run: | syntax in a GitHub Actions workflow:

yaml
Copy code
jobs:
  my-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run a multiline script
        run: |
          echo "This is line 1"
          echo "This is line 2"
          echo "This is line 3"

/* ----------------------------------- job ---------------------------------- */
each Operating System need diffrent Job
each job work in parallel

/* ---------------------------------- shell --------------------------------- */
to run anther terminal on os in vm   that means shell not exist on os but it will start vm for the shell
ex:
windows-command:
runs-on: windows-latest
steps:
  - name: runs command
    run: Get-Location 
  - name: bash directory 
    run: pwd
    shell: bash  # windows does not have bash shell  but it will start vm for you

/* ---------------------------------- need ---------------------------------- */
by default  jobs run in parallel if job depends on anther use 
need: [ job name ]

ex:

# name : ahmed  comands

# on : [push]
# jobs :
#   run-dbah-commands:
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#     steps:
#       - name : echo a 
#         run: echo "hello world"
#       - name: multline script
#         run: |
#           node -v
#           npm -v



name : ahmed_workfloe

on: [push]

jobs:
  sh-command:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: runs command
        run: echo "hello ahmed  world "
    
  windows-command:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    needs: [ sh-command]  # job  windows-command will runs after sh-command
      - name: runs command
        run: Get-Location 
      - name: bash directory 
        run: pwd
        shell: bash


* actions can have inputs  ( with:)  and we can use other actions that published in GitHub
ex:

name : javaScript-workflow

on: [push]

jobs:
  run-js-job:
    runs-on : ubuntu-latest
    steps:
     - name: import js 
       id: greet # steps can has id 
       uses: actions/hello-world-javascript-action@main   # use other actions 
       with:
        who-to-greet:  dbah
     - name: log greet
       run : echo "${{ steps.greet.output.time}}"
 
 /* --------------------------- actions/checkout@v3 -------------------------- */
 to clone your code to te current directory of the terminal use  actions/checkout@v3 available in GitHub
 ex:

 
name : javaScript-workflow
   
on: [push]

jobs:
  run-js-job:
    runs-on : ubuntu-latest
    steps:
     - name: checkout
       uses: actions/checkout@v3 # without this step the   ls -a will  not list any file 
     - name: list fils 
       run: |
         pwd
         ls -a

/* ------------------------------ activity type ----------------------------- */
some events has Specific actitvity type like pull_request

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
      - closed
    branches:
      - main
if you not specify the type it has default like opend 

/* -------------------------------- schedule -------------------------------- */
use do schedule  action every specific time 
to learn more about cron go to  https://crontab.guru/

ex:
name : javaScript-workflow-schedule
   
on:
  schedule:
  - cron: "0/5 * * * *"  # run every 5 minites  the minimam time to run is every 5 minits

  /* --------------------------- repository_dispatch -------------------------- */

  GitHub Actions external triggers allow you to start a workflow run in response to an external
   event, such as an API call. This feature enables various use cases to automate workflows based on events outside the repository

   Usecases 
Manual Workflow Triggers:
  You can set up an external trigger to manually start a workflow run.
   This can be useful for scenarios where a human intervention is required before certain automated processes are initiated

example
1-GitHub actions   
on:
  # schedule:
  # - cron: "0/5 * * * *"
  repository_dispatch: 
    types: [build] # could be anything 


2- postman 
  *post metho on  (https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repository/dispatches)  # ex :https://api.github.com/repos/AhmedAbdelerhman/gitHub-actions/dispatches
  *get token from github settings  and put it on  basic authrization on filed password  (postman)
  * send on bady json : {
    "event_type":"build" #  build is the same word in gitHub action 
}
